This is a mini project built using OpenAI.

The program generates a paragraph of approximately 300 words. At the beginning, it prompts the user to decide whether they want to start the program. 
If the user chooses to proceed, the program then asks for a topic on which the paragraph should be generated.

The project uses an OpenAI API key, which has been removed for security reasons. 
To run the program successfully, you can clone the project, add your own API key and ensure that all required packages are installed.
